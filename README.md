# VirDTL

VirDTL is a computational protocol for inference of both ancestral and extant
strain recombination in viral genomes, using phylogenetic reconciliation.
Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) reconciliation accounts for incongruencies
between the strain evolution tree and the evolutionary trees of each gene
family by inferring a history of gene duplications, gene losses, and
horizontal gene transfers (HGT). In the viral setting, HGTs correspond to
viral recombinations, so DTL reconciliation can be used to infer
recombination. 

VirDTL is described in the paper ["Phylogenetic reconciliation reveals 
extensive ancestral recombination in sarbecoviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 
lineage"](Link TBD) by Zaman, Sledzieski, Berger, Wu, and Bansal.
